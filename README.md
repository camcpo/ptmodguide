Hello! Today I will go through how to install mods for the hit 2D platformer, Pizza Tower!

The first step to installing a mod to your game is actually finding a mod to install, the mod I will be using is the "Funny Eevee As Peppino V0.4" which can be found at https://gamebanana.com/mods/433181

After you have your xdelta file, you wanna download xdelta patcher. This will let you patch your data.win file.

You can find xdelta patcher at: https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/

After you download the xdelta patcher, you want to open the patcher file in the folder.



Once your inside the application, it should look like this:

Once you have opened it, click the folder icon to the right of the original file box. The directory you can find your data.win file in is your Pizza Tower directory, to find it, follow this image.

After you click "Browse local files," your screen should look like this.

After that, paste it into the xdelta original file open box and boom, your ready to put in your xdelta file.


To actually patch the game with the mod, you wanna go to the XDelta patch box and do the same, but with your .xdelta file.
After done, your screen should look like this.

Once your screen is like that, press the "Apply patch" button and if it says "Patch successfully applied" you have done it.

If it says Checksum Validation Faliure or something like that, press this off and try again. If another error pops up, I dont know what to do about it.
